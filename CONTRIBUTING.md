# Contributing

Thank you for thinking about contributing to Super!


## General guidelines

There are a few ground rules that to adhere to:

* be friendly and patient,
* be welcoming,
* be considerate,
* be respectful,
* be careful in the words that you choose and be kind to others,
* when we disagree, try to understand why.

This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it in
the spirit in which it's intended - a guide to make it easier to communicate and
participate in the community.

This applies to all spaces managed by the Super project.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report
it by emailing: super+conduct at zachahn.com

Offenders may be banned, asked to apologize, etc.

(These guidelines are based on the [FreeBSD CoC][FreeBSD CoC], which in turn is
based on [LLVM Project's draft CoC][LLVM CoC], which in turn is based on the
[Django Project Code of Conduct][Django CoC], which is in turn based on wording
from the Speak Up! project.)


## Bug reports / issues

## Feature requests / pull requests

Contributors will need to sign a CLA. This isn't set up yet, so I won't be able
to accept contributions.

1. Please note that pull requests may be closed/denied for any reason.
   Your feature may be better as its own repository. If so, I will link to your
   project from the README!
1. Please allow Super's contributors to modify your PR before merging.
   It might make the process a bit smoother, but this isn't a necessity.
