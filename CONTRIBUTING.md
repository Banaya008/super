# Contributing

Thank you for thinking about contributing to Super!


## General guidelines

1. Be nice!
1. Be forgiving! People make mistakes
1. Be forgiving! It's very easy to miscommunicate over the internet
1. Be friendly! Apologize quickly!

And sadly; you may be banned for consistently breaking these guidelines ðŸ˜¢


## Bug reports / issues

1. Please tell us what version of Super, Ruby, and Rails you are using
1. Please search the issues before posting your problem
1. Please ask questions in a public place to benefit all Super users
1. Please email security-related problems to super dash (as in `-`) security at

## Feature requests / pull requests

Contributors will need to sign a CLA. This isn't set up yet, so I won't be able
to accept contributions.

1. Please note that pull requests may be closed/denied for any reason.
   Your feature may be better as its own repository. If so, I will link to your
   project from the README!
1. Please allow Super's contributors to modify your PR before merging!
   It might make the process a bit smoother, but this isn't a necessity.
