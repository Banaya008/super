Description:
    Creates the necessary files for assets to be served under Webpacker

    Webpacker support requires ERB support. There are no other dependencies.

    Installing ERB on webpacker is usually done by running the command:
    `rails webpacker:install:erb`

Example:
    rails webpacker:install:erb             # if you hadn't set up ERB already
    rails generate super:install:webpacker

    This will create:
        app/javascript/packs/super/application.js.erb
