Description:
    Creates the necessary files for assets to be served under Webpacker

    Webpacker support requires that you install ERB support for Webpacker.

    Installing ERB on webpacker is usually done by running the command:
    `rails webpacker:install:erb`

Example:
    rails webpacker:install:erb             # if you hadn't set up ERB already
    rails generate super:webpacker

    This will:
        Create app/javascript/packs/super/application.js.erb
        Modify config/initializers/super.rb
