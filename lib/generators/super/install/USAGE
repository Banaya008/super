Description:
    Set up all required files for the Super admin framework.

Options:
    --controller-namespace
        This specifies the directory into which generated controllers should be
        placed. This also specifies the parent controller that all Super admin
        pages would inherit from (see examples). Generated controllers will
        automatically inherit from the controller that is specified through this
        option.

    --route-namespace
        Since this generator only creates one inheritable parent controller,
        this option only affects the generated initializer.

Example:
    rails generate super:install

    This will create:
        config/initializers/super.rb
        app/controllers/admin_controller.rb
        app/controllers/admin/.keep
        app/super/.keep

Example:
    rails generate super:install --controller-namespace badminton

    This will create:
        config/initializers/super.rb
        app/controllers/badminton_controller.rb
        app/controllers/badminton/.keep
        app/super/.keep
