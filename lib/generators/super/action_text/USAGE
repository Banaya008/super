Description:
    Creates the necessary files for Super to support ActionText

    Prerequisites:

        * Webpacker must be installed on your Rails app
            * Run: bundle exec rails webpacker:install

        * ActionText must be installed on your Rails app
            * Run: bundle exec rails action_text:install

    Note that Super does NOT need to be configured to use Webpacker. But if you
    do use Super with Webpacker, you can merge `action_text.js` into
    `application.js.erb` file.

Example:
    bin/rails webpacker:install             # if you haven't already
    bin/rails action_text:install           # if you haven't already
    bin/rails generate super:action_text

    This will:
        Create app/javascript/packs/super/action_text.js
        Modify config/initializers/super.rb
