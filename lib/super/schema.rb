  # The Schema is a general purpose container for describing the "schema"
  # for various purposes. It primarily exists to provide a cohesive user-facing
  # API for defining schemas.

  # The various "schema types" are likely of more interest
  class Schema
    # This class can be thought of as a Hash, where the keys usually refer to
    # the model's column name and the value refers to the column type. Note
    # though that this isn't always the caseâ€”different `SchemaTypes` can do
    # whatever makes sense in their context
