## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "super"
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec rails generate super:install # check out the `--help` option!
```

If you prefer, you can configure Super to use Webpacker instead of Sprockets.
Check out the [Webpacker guide](./webpacker.md).
