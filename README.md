Super is an admin framework for Ruby on Rails applications. Super helps you make
admin pages quickly and provides a powerful interface for admins to use.

It's distinguishing feature is that it's easy for you to maintain in your
application. It does this by having zero dependenciesâ€”this lets you update your
app's dependencies without worrying about breaking your admin pages, and vice
versa, update your admin pages without breaking your app.

Note: Super is under active development and will likely have a few more breaking
changes before 1.0.


## Features

* Responsive and mobile-friendly web pages
* Automatic controllers that work without any configuration
* Configurable forms
    * Supports nested attributes `accepts_nested_attributes_for`
    * New and edit forms can be totally different
* Configurable display (index and show tables)
    * Supports showing computed values that aren't backed by database fields
* Advanced filtering/search
* Compatible with Sprockets and Webpacker
* Pre-built frontend assets. Super doesn't depend on Sass, PostCSS, Babel, etc
* Carefully chosen, vendored frontend assets
    * Stimulus JS v2
    * Tailwind CSS v2
    * Rails UJS
    * Flatpickr
* Builds on top of standard Rails controllers and ERB views
* Plenty of escape hatches for those very customized pages
* No DSL. Configure your admin pages by setting methods and returning objects
* Supports Rails 5.0+, 6.0+
* Supports Ruby 2.3+, 3.0+


See the [demo][demo] and its [source][demo_source] for an example of some of its
features. See the [docs][docs] for a walkthrough.


## Quick start

Add this line anywhere in your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "super"
```

Then install Super by running:

```
bundle install
bin/rails g super:install
```

You can create admin pages by running this for all the models you want:

```
bin/rails g super:resource ModelName
```


## Super doesn't fit my needs. What are some alternatives?

[ActiveAdmin](https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin) is great if you need
lots of features. It relies heavily on DSLs but is flexible and popular.

[Administrate](https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate) doesn't have as many
features as ActiveAdmin, but it feels like developing a normal Rails app.
